# Memory Game (`Kotlin`)

A matching game which was an old project I originally wrote in Java and decided to rewrite in
Kotlin. The layout was created dynamically instead of the traditional XML layout.

Composed of 3 classes:

- `MainActivity` - displays the main layout and plots the cards that to be used for the game
- `Card` - contains a list of resources to be used, as well as sizes, margins, and number of cards
  to be displayed
- `FlipAnimation` - defines the flip animation to be applied on each card when selected

## General description:

A classic card pair-matching game where the objective is to find all matching pairs of cards.

## Benefits:

Memory pair games are not only fun but also highly beneficial in improving memory and concentration,
thus enhancing oneâ€™s cognitive skills.
